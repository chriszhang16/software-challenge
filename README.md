# Rock-Scissors-Paper Game
As part of the software challenge, you'll need to implement this popular game in 2-player mode. Each player is presented an interface where they can make a choice between the three options. Once a player makes their choice, they should be directed to another page that reports the status of the game. For each player the status can be one of the following four:

* Other player has not made their choice yet
* You won the game (other player has made a choice X)
* You lost the game (other player has made a choice Y)
* The game resulted in a tie (other player has made the same choice as you)
