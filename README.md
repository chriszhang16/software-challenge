# Rock-Scissors-Paper Game

## Problem Statement
As part of the software challenge, you'll need to implement this popular game in 2-player mode. Each player should be presented a form where they can make a choice between the three available options. Once the player makes their choice, they should be directed to a game status page. For each player the status can be one of the following four:

1. Other player has not made their choice yet
2. You won the game (other player has made a choice X)
3. You lost the game (other player has made a choice Y)
4. The game resulted in a tie (other player has made the same choice as you)

## Implementation Details
You are free to implement the challenge in any programming language and/or web framework. Depending on your area of expertise, you may choose to implement the front end component, the back end component of the challenge or both. For example, if you are a full-stack generalist or backend developer with some basic HTML knowledge, you may choose to implement the entire functionality of the game. If you are only familiar with Frontend / UI, we'd expect to see something impressive for the user interface.

If you choose a fully-responsive framework like Meteor or ReactJS, it'd be nice if the status page would reflect the actual status of the game without the need for refreshing. For example, once the first player makes their choice, they would be directed to the status page with the outcome #1. Once the second player makes their choice, the status will be automatically updated to one of #2 - #4.
